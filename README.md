# markdown-books

`markdown-books` is used to manage typora books. `Typora`+`mdbook` are my favorite markdown writing tools. However, it doesn't support multi-directory switch function.

So I wrote this simple tool for manage my editing books.

## freeze to exe

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile MarkdownBooksImp.py
```
